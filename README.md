# Getting Started with Stripe Payments and Express.js
<p>
Stripe is a popular payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept payments online. </br>
Express.js is a popular web framework for Node.js that allows you to build web applications quickly and easily. </br>
By integrating Stripe with Express.js, you can quickly and easily accept payments on your website or app.</br>
</p>

##**To get started with Stripe Payments and Express.js, follow these steps:**

# Step 1: Create a Stripe Account

To use Stripe Payments, you'll need to sign up for a Stripe account. </br>
Go to the Stripe website and sign up for a free account. </br>
Once you've signed up, you'll be taken to the Stripe dashboard.</br>

# Step 2: Install the Stripe Node.js Library

Next, you'll need to install the Stripe Node.js library.</br>
Open up your terminal and run the following command:</br>
```
npm install stripe
```

# Step 3: Set Up Your Project

Create a new project in your preferred code editor and initialize a new npm package by </br> 
running the following command in your project's root directory:</br>
```
npm init -y
```
Next, create a new file called app.js and add the following code
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const stripe = require('stripe')('<your_stripe_secret_key>');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

```
This sets up a basic Express.js app and initializes the Stripe library with your Stripe secret key.

# Step 4: Create a Payment Form

To accept payments, you'll need to create a payment form. </br>
Here's an example of a simple payment form that you can add to your **`app.js`** file:</br>

```
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.get('/payment', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    <form action="/charge" method="post">
      <div>
        <label>Amount:</label>
        <input type="text" name="amount" placeholder="Enter amount in USD">
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>Card Number:</label>
        <input type="text" name="card_number" placeholder="Enter card number">
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>Expiration Date:</label>
        <input type="text" name="exp_month" placeholder="MM">
        <input type="text" name="exp_year" placeholder="YYYY">
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>CVC:</label>
        <input type="text" name="cvc" placeholder="Enter CVC">
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Pay</button>
    </form>
  `);
});

```
This creates a payment form with fields for the payment amount, card number, expiration date, and CVC.

# Step 5: Handle Payments with Stripe

Next, you'll need to handle payments with Stripe.</br>
Here's an example of how you can handle payments using the `charge` endpoint in **Express.js**:</br>
